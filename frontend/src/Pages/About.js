                        <p className="mt-2 text-left space-y-3">The Ministry of Environment was founded in 1985 as the Department of Environment under the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office.
                            In 1992, it was renamed as the Ministry of Environment and Forests.
                            In 2014, it was restructured as the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.
                            In 2021, it was further reorganized as the Ministry of Environment with a focus on e-waste management and recycling. Some of our notable achievements include launching the National Action Plan on Climate Change in 2008,
                            hosting the Conference of Parties (COP) 14 of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in 2019, and initiating the E-Waste Facility Locator project in 2023.

                        <p className="mt-2 text-left">This website is a part of the E-Waste Facility Locator project, which is an initiative of the Ministry of Environment to promote e-waste management and recycling in India.
                            We aim to provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for users to find the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility in their area.
                            We also offer educational pop-ups that inform users about the harmful components of their e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly.
                            We also reward users for disposing their e-waste correctly by giving them credit points relative to the value of the precious metals recovered from their old devices, which they can redeem for coupons, vouchers, or donations to environmental causes.
                            The website is designed and developed by a team of students, who participated in the Smart India Hackathon 2023,
                        a nationwide competition organized by the Ministry of Education and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to solve various problems faced by different ministries and departments of the Government of India.
